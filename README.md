# NotSoStatic

### What is it?
A library to make js on github pages not so static (lol)
It achieves this through usage of the git api! Checkout `nss.js` for more.

### Inspiration
This project is heavily based on flask and pertains to features I enjoyed using from there

### Installation
Simply clone this repo, `cd` to the `template` folder and modify it as you wish. 

This library is fully catered to github pages and does not support any other static hosting service

### Usage

NotSoStatic comes with 3 main components

1. RouteManager - this adds and sets routes to return html from

2. Template manager - this loads templates from a given folder

3. File manager - read access to your repository from your github pages site!

(Write access will be added later on but that's a molehill for another day)

You can find out how to use NSS in the `examples/` directory

[A very simple demo here!](https://wynwxst.github.io/nss-demo/blog?post=%27hi%20,%20you%20can%20change%20?post=%20to%20anything%20:D%20and%20if%20you%20look%20at%20the%20repo,%20this%20page%20doesn%27t%20actually%20exist!%27)

### Disclaimer

This is version 1.0, expect and report bugs and issues please :)
